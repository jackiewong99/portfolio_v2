## üè† Built and hosted on:

- [React.js](https://beta.reactjs.org/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. Install and use the correct version of Node using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

   ```
   nvm install
   ```

2. Install the dependencies (_"i" is short for install_)

   ```
   npm i
   ```

3. Run the app in the development mode

   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.
   You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## üéâ Build for Production

1. Builds the app for production

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

   It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

2. Deploy your app
